# Breaking Point Mod

Breaking Point Mod is a total conversion mod for Arma 3. Source is provided for the community to improve the mod and host their own servers. Released under the [Arma Public Share Like Licence](https://www.bistudio.com/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike) (APL-SA).

## Objectives & Goals

* Provide a better version of the mod for people still playing. While the developers focus work on the standalone version.
* Compatibility with Arma  Updates / New Maps / DLC etc.
* Move Away from Breaking Point Launcher / The Zombie Infection Specific Code & Requirements. This removes a time / money cost and allows the official developers to spend all their time working on the standalone game.
* Intergrate Launcher Features (Legion System, Viewing Faction Points and Stats into the Main Game)
* Cross Platform Support ( Windows, Mac, Linux ) / This allows for hosting dedicated servers on Linux with a cheaper server cost.
* Release a Official Update with all these fixes. Submit a pull request with improvements and we will merge that into the game.

## Conflicts & Problems

* Fragmentation: Everyone using a custom version of Breaking Point and hosting vastly different servers and configurations. If we can work together and merge fixes into Breaking Point as a community.

## Server Configuration
## Prerequisites

* These steps assume you already know how to setup/install a MySQL database and basic ArmA server yourself, so do this first.
* Make sure you install the Visual C++ 2015 Redistributables from microsoft.
	* https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=48145

## Configuration

* Download the BreakingPoint Client + Server files to your server (A batch file will be included in a tools folder for steam cmd users).
	##### If downloading using the steam client and uploading to your server.
	* Subscribe to the following mods on the workshop and copy each to your ArmA server directory.
	* Make sure the folders have the correct names on your server (@BreakingPoint and @BreakingPointServer).
	* BreakingPoint Client: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=426629791
	* BreakingPoint Server: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1133182382

	##### If using the provided batch tool.
	* Copy the batch file to your server directory (or wherever you like), open it and make the following changes.
	* Make sure you set the correct username and password for steam (The workshop disallows downloads if you're not using a account that owns ArmA 3).
	```
	set steam_username=MySteamUser
	set steam_password=MySteamPassword
	```
	* Make sure you set the correct path to your SteamCMD install.
	```
	set "steamcmd_dir=C:\Path\To\SteamCMD"
	```
	* Make sure you set the correct path to your ArmA server directory.
	```
	set "arma_serverdir=C:\Path\To\Server\"
	```
	* Save the file once all the above changes have been made, remember to keep the quotes around the file path settings or you will get errors
	* Double click the batch file and will do everything else for you (you may need to input a steam guard code as you would when using the steam client).

* Import the included breakingpoint.sql file from the SQL folder to a clean database and make sure you have a sql account that has full access to that database.
* Copy the ServerConfig folder to your ArmA server directory.
* Open the BreakingPointExt.ini in ServerConfig and change the database ip, name, username, password and port to the ones you setup earlier.
	```
	[DATABASE]
	ip = 127.0.0.1
	port = 3306
	database = breakingpointmod
	username = root
	password =
	```
* Open the config.cfg in ServerConfig directory and setup your instance, this is important to remember for each server you host.
	```
	class Params
	{
		instance = 1;
		debug = false;
	};
	```
* Set the correct mission file for the map you'd like to run.
	```
	/*
	List of mission names.
	"BP1_BreakingPoint.Altis" //Altis
	"BP2_BreakingPoint.Stratis" //Stratis
	"BP4_BreakingPoint.Thirsk" //Thirsk
	"BP3_BreakingPoint.ThirskW" //Thirsk Winter
	"BP5_BreakingPoint.Tanoa" //Tanoa
	"BP6_BreakingPoint.newhaven" //Newhaven
	"BP7_BreakingPoint.Esseker" //Esseker
	"BP8_BreakingPoint.Chernarus" //Chernarus
	"BP9_BreakingPoint.namalsk" //Namalsk
	*/
	class Missions
	{
	  class BreakingPoint
	  {
		  template = "BP1_BreakingPoint.Altis";
		  difficulty = "Regular";
		  class Params
		  {
			  instance = 1;
			  debug = false;
		  };
	  };
	};
	```
* Open your database manager and go to the instance table and set the world id for instance 1 to what map you intend on running, here's a list of possible values.
	```
	World ID | Map
	1 | Altis
	2 | Stratis
	3 | Thirsk
	4 | Bornholm
	5 | Newhaven
	6 | Esseker
	8 | Chernarus;
	9 | Namalsk
	11 | Legion
	12 | Tanoa
	```
* Remember if you open more servers increment the instance = x; by one in your server's config.cfg and then in the database set the world id correctly for that instance id
* Copy the included server_start.bat file from the Tools folder to your server directory and edit as necessary (The defaults provided will work for a 64 Bit server running on port 2302).
* Double click the batch file and wait for the server to start, if everything went successfully you should see the server start and a console displayed saying the following.
	```
	Starting Connection To Databases...
	Database Connection Success (Game DB)
	```

## Custom Server Configfile
* Download from Github "breakingpointmod/ServerConfiguration" the folder "breakingpoint_server_config" to your server 
* Edit the config.cpp in the "breakingpoint_server_config" to your server liking
* Pack the folder "breakingpoint_server_config" to a .pbo and put it in your server root directory inside "@BreakingPointServer/addons"
